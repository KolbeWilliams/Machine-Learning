# Machine-Learning
These are some machine learning assignments that I have completed. Some utilize built-in functions and others user fewer built-in functions to demonstrate how the algorithms work. Some highlights include a project where I use machine learning to detect credit card fraud and an assignment where I use naive bayes to detect spam emails (HW7).
